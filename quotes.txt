#15 At night time I sleep dreaming of you, and in the day time I dream of sleeping with you.

#24 You’re like a .com domain name – already taken. And I ain’t about to settle for no .org.
#25 Don’t listen to your friends, listen to your heart.

#28 In my opinion, God’s only mistake when he made the world was that he didn’t keep you to himself.

#37 Tired out. Been running around like a nutcase at work today. I’m too much of a perfectionist. I’m a perfectionist in most things I do. That’s why I like you so much.
